# my_threejs_project
testing the three.js

For testing purposes I created the 3D presentation of a gear with Three.js.
The gear model is exported from SolidWorks2017 in .STL format, and the special STLLoader.js is used to present the gear with the Three.js.

To see the presentation, please first start a local python server inside the cloned directory using:

`python -m http.server`

And type in the browser:

`http://localhost:8000/`

There you can access the files from the directory, please use the gear_test.html to see the 3D presentation of the gear.
